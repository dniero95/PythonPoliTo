## Testo dell'esercizio

Scrivete un programma che legga tutte le righe di un file di testo (_input.txt_), ne inverta l’ordine e le scriva in un altro file (output.txt). Ad esempio, se il file _input.txt_ contiene queste righe:


```
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.
```

allora il file _output.txt_ conterrà:

```
The lamb was sure to go.
And everywhere that Mary went
Its fleece was white as snow
Mary had a little lamb
```
